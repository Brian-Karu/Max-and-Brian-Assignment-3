The difference between the outputs for 2013 and 2019 is very hard to see. There was not much change when looking at Singapore as a whole. However upon zooming into the outer neighborhoods around the northern perimeter you can see that those areas got lighter and there has been an increase in night time lights. This can be due to the expansion of urban areas and 24 hour stores. The areas that had a large amount of night time lights in 2013 were seen in similar fasion in 2019, not much changed. This was also seen as the most populated area.
